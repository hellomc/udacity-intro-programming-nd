    <h4 class=sub-topic>How does the Web Work?</h4>
    <p>
      The user accesses the web by opening the browser, a software application that runs on computers. This application will display various files (i.e. plain text, HTML (hypertext markup language), images, videos, and music).
    </p>
    <p>
      These files are hosted in servers. When a user types into the browser a website, such as www.bbc.com, the computer sends an HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) to a server. Then the server locates the specific HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer.

    <h4 class=sub-topic>HTML Fundamentals</h4>
    <p>
      <span>Typically, HTML elements will have an <b>opening</b> and <b>closing</b> tag with content in between the tags.</span><br>
      <span>Some HTML elements will contain one or more <b>attributes</b> in the opening tag that indicate other characteristics of the HTML element.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements create an invisible box around its inside content. Span and div tags are respectively inline and block elements.

    </p>

    <h4 class=sub-topic>Document Structure Imitates Tree</h4>
    <p>
      HTML is organized in a Document Object Model(DOM) tree. This tree structure can be applied to multiple languages and across platforms to represent and interact with objects in HTML (and other markup languages).
    </p>
    <p>
      Indenting in HTML indicates the persistence of a single idea. At the beginning of an idea, the indentation increases and towards the end the indentation decreases.
